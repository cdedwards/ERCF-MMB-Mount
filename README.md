# ERCF-MMB-Mount
ERCF MMB mount for attachment to 2020. I looked for a mount that would attach the mmb to my ercf in some way. I do NOT have a buffer other than filamentalist rewinders. This particular mount is for a mmbv2 from BTT. It was created but some cut/paste of two other mounts. Two bolts, and a couple of T-Nuts and your good to mount the mmbv2 from the 2020.
